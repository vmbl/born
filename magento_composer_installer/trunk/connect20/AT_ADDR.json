Many storeowners' profit margins are so thin that any additional costs associated with fulfillment will put you in the red. \n\nAccurateTax realizes how important accurate address data is not just for sales tax calculations, but also for shipping purposes.  To this end, we have created the US Address Validation service from AccurateTax.  Originally, the Address validation service was solely intended to determine what the zip+4 zipcodes were for sales tax calculation purposes; however, we quickly realized as we began using the service ourselves that this solution would likely decrease the costly address correction fees that many shippers charge when addresses have not been validated.","authors":[{"name":"Donald Organ","email":"dorgan@donaldorgan.com"}],"version":"1.0","require":{},"suggest":{"magento-hackathon\/magento-composer-installer":"Allows to manage this package as a dependency"},"dist":{"type":"tar","url":"http:\/\/connect20.magentocommerce.com\/community\/AT_ADDR\/1.0\/AT_ADDR-1.0.tgz"},"extra":{"package-xml":"package.xml"}}}}}
