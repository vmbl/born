If the law changes, these texts update automatically and the extension synchronizes the new one to the right position. At that point, online traders are protected against legal proceedings.","authors":[{"name":"Viktor Franz","email":"vf@integer-net.de"}],"version":"1.0.0","require":{},"suggest":{"magento-hackathon\/magento-composer-installer":"Allows to manage this package as a dependency"},"dist":{"type":"tar","url":"http:\/\/connect20.magentocommerce.com\/community\/protected-shops\/1.0.0\/protected-shops-1.0.0.tgz"},"extra":{"package-xml":"package.xml"}}}}}
